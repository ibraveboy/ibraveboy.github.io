                As a Team Lead at Abhi Pvt Ltd, a cutting-edge Fin-tech company,
                I lead and manage a dynamic team responsible for the development
                and maintenance of various web portals. When I initially joined
                the company as a MERN Stack Developer, I swiftly immersed myself
                in the intricate world of React JS and AWS Lambda, gaining
                expertise in crafting efficient and scalable web solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the course of seven months, my dedication and technical
                acumen caught the attention of the company's leadership, leading
                to my promotion to the coveted position of Team Lead. In this
                role, I am entrusted with overseeing the entire development
                lifecycle of our web portals, including both front-end and
                back-end aspects. I ensure that tasks are effectively delegated
                among team members, fostering a collaborative and productive
                environment where every team member's skills are harnessed to
                their fullest potential.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, I am actively involved in coordinating with other
                departments and stakeholders to understand their requirements
                and translate them into actionable tasks for my team. By
                fostering effective communication and collaboration, we ensure
                that the final deliverables align with the company's vision and
                meet the needs of our users.

              <p>
                During my tenure at Renegade Furniture Group, I embarked on an
                exciting journey of growth and accomplishment as a React JS
                developer. Initially hired as a Junior React JS developer, my
                dedication and rapid progress led to a well-deserved promotion
                to the position of Senior React JS developer within just three
                months.
              </p>
              <p>
                Renegade Furniture Group, a prominent eCommerce store
                specializing in furniture, had a solid foundation built on
                Magento. However, to elevate the user experience and leverage
                the potential of modern frontend technologies, the company
                embarked on a crucial transformation. The decision to migrate
                the frontend to ReactJS from Magento marked a pivotal turning
                point in the company's technological landscape.
              </p>
              <p>
                Navigating the intricacies of ReactJS, I collaborated with
                <b>Team Lead</b> to optimize the user interface, enhance the
                website's performance, and elevate the overall user experience.
                My expertise in ReactJS allowed me to craft seamless and
                interactive interfaces, resulting in a significant improvement
                in the website's usability and customer engagement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout this transformative process, I actively contributed
                to refining the company's development practices. Embracing agile
                methodologies, I participated in scrum meetings, code reviews,
                and collaborated on design discussions, fostering a
                collaborative and innovative environment within the development
                team
              </p>
              <p>
                Working at Renegade Furniture Group was a fulfilling experience,
                as I witnessed firsthand how my contributions played a pivotal
                role in the company's digital transformation. The opportunity to
                work with a passionate and talented team on a project of such
                significance further fueled my enthusiasm for web development
                and solidified my expertise as a Senior React JS developer

              <div class="subheading mb-3">BevVeg Vegan Certification</div>
              <p>
                During my six-month tenure at BevVeg, I had the privilege of
                contributing as a part-time MERN Stack developer to a
                groundbreaking project. BevVeg, a company specializing in
                providing vegan production certification to its clients,
                envisioned streamlining their certification process through an
                intuitive web application. As a key member of their remote
                development team, I played a crucial role in turning this vision
                into a reality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working alongside their team, I focused on building dynamic
                forms that allowed their clients to effortlessly enter the
                necessary details of their products. These forms were designed
                to capture critical information accurately, facilitating a
                seamless certification process for BevVeg's clients.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, I undertook the responsibility of creating a
                robust module to automatically generate certificates once the
                product details were received. These certificates were then
                stored in designated Google Drive folders as PDF files, ensuring
                secure and organized documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond my contributions to the web application, I also
                collaborated on enhancing their mobile app, built in
                React-Native. My role involved addressing and resolving various
                bugs, thereby enhancing the app's functionality and user
                experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Balancing this remote part-time role with my full-time position
                at VvorkCloud Technologies was undoubtedly a rewarding
                challenge. However, as my commitment to both jobs intensified, I
                realized the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life
                balance. Unfortunately, handling two demanding roles
                simultaneously proved to be unsustainable for me, ultimately
                leading me to part ways with BevVeg after six months
              </p>
              <p>
                I am grateful for the knowledge and experiences gained during my
                stint at BevVeg, and I am eager to continue my journey as a
                dedicated MERN Stack developer, creating innovative solutions
                that leave a lasting mark on the world of web development.

              <p>
                At Vvork Cloud Technologies, I embarked on an incredible journey
                as a Junior JavaScript developer, where I had the privilege of
                diving headfirst into the world of JavaScript and honing my
                skills in the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The
                company's primary focus was on providing comprehensive Bootcamps
                centered around the MERN Stack, catering to aspiring developers
                seeking to master these cutting-edge technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a key member of their development team, I actively
                contributed to the enhancement and maintenance of their website,
                which was meticulously built using React and Node. This
                experience allowed me to gain practical insights into the
                intricacies of these frameworks and deepened my understanding of
                building seamless user experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                During my tenure, I also had the opportunity to undertake
                several small projects in JavaScript and React, which were
                ingeniously integrated into their Bootcamp curriculum. Building
                these projects not only expanded my technical prowess but also
                enabled me to witness firsthand how my work contributed to
                empowering aspiring developers in their learning journey.
              </p>
              <p>
                Driven by a thirst for knowledge and growth, I dedicated extra
                hours to learning React and Node, taking on new challenges and
                pushing my boundaries further. This relentless pursuit of
                excellence was recognized, and within a year, I was promoted to
                a Senior role, a testament to my dedication and passion for web
                development.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, my journey at Vvork Cloud Technologies extended beyond
                the realms of web development, as I also delved into the world
                of React Native. This exposure to mobile app development added
                yet another dimension to my skill set, equipping me with
                versatile abilities to create engaging and dynamic user
                interfaces across various platforms.
              </p>
              <p>
                The skills and experiences I gained at Vvork Cloud Technologies
                have been invaluable, shaping me into the developer I am today.
                I look back on my time there with fondness and appreciation for
                the knowledge, growth, and passion for JavaScript and MERN Stack
                development that it instilled in me.

                embraced the challenges and opportunities this role presented,
                making it my mission to continuously learn and grow.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a fresh graduate, this was my first professional experience,
                and I was determined to make the most of it. With an unwavering
                commitment to personal and professional development, I pushed
                myself harder, immersing myself in the intricacies of PHP and
                backend development. Balancing the demands of the job, I made
                sure to allocate time for learning and upskilling while ensuring
                that my deliverables were consistently delivered on time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond PHP development, I also took the opportunity to delve
                deeper into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I recognized the value of
                a holistic understanding of web technologies, which further
                enriched my ability to craft seamless and user-friendly
                interfaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                The lessons and experiences I gained at AUWDTech have been
                invaluable, propelling me forward in my career and shaping me
                into the dedicated and resourceful developer I am today.

          <p>
            Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
            indoors. I listen to lectures of different scholars. Because I love
            to learn about my religion and It is my hobby to listen the stories
            of converts. Sheikh Abdal Hakim Murad, dean of Muslim Cambridge
            College UK, is my favorite speaker. I also love to listen different
            speakers so that I can have different perspectives of the things in
            my religion.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television
            shows, I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest
